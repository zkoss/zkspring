* Upgrade Notes:
  + zkspring.jar of 1.2.0 is now split into two separate jar files, zkspring-core.jar for Spring core 
    and zkspring-security.jar for Spring Security.
  + zkspring-security.jar depends on zkspring-core.jar. This also means corresponding .xsd files 
    containing namespace definitions are also split. Please take a look at our online documentation 
	for specific details.
  + ZK Spring Core schema namespace and location are http://www.zkoss.org/2008/core
    http://www.zkoss.org/2008/core/zkspring-core.xsd
  + ZK Spring Security schema namespace and location are http://www.zkoss.org/2008/security
    http://www.zkoss.org/2008/security/zkspring-security.xsd
  + Due to changes in Spring Security 3.0.2 release Zk Spring Security defined custom filters now 
    needs to be configured in Spring Security configuration file. Please take a look at our online 
	documentation for specific details(http://docs.zkoss.org/wiki/Spring).
  + Since it is upgraded to Spring 3.0 version it can only be used with Java 1.5 and higher version.
  + Spring Webflow 2.0.3 and above is not compatible with Spring 3.0 yet hence ZK Spring Webflow 
    support is not included in this 3.0RC release. For ZK Spring Webflow needs continue using ZK 
	Spring 1.2.0 and earlier releases.
